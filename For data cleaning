# For Invisible Special Charaters which cause the results to come back as 0 items found, use normalize

SELECT * FROM sample
WHERE NORMALIZE (name, NFKC) ='Jane Doe'
# BigQuery also has a NORMALIZE_AND_CASEFOLD function if you want string comparison to be case insensitive, 
# i.e. records containing Jane Doe or jane doe, will be returned in the query results

#Pattern Matching
SELECT * FROM sample
WHERE CONTAINS_SUBSTR (color, 'green' );

#ENDS_WITH function to check if a string ends with a pattern. A common use case I couldâ€™ve used this for was checking if an email ends wth something you are looking for
